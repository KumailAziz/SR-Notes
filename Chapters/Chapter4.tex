\section{Paradoxes of SR}

\subsection{Pole in Barn}
Discuss the two approaches, the spacetime diagrams and the issue of locking the doors (simultaneity)

\subsection{Twin Paradox}
3 approaches: Without acceleration, relativistic Doppler effect and communication between twins (Spacetime diagram)

\subsection{Dr. Jawad's Train Tunnel paradox}
It is the same as pole in barn paradox, but here the new this is a bomb is fixed on the train and it will explode if the train is in the tunnel.
